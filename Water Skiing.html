<h1>Waterskiing</h1>
<h2>Water skiing was added as an Olympic sport in 1972, drawing even more recognition and authenticity to it.</h2>
<h2>Waterskiing can be performed using 1 or 2 skis and you are towed behind the boat at about 75 feet. Water skiing reuires upper and lower body strength and good balance and endurance.</h2>
<h3>The boat should go about 20-30 Miles Per Hour when towing a waterskier.</h3>
<h3> Waterskiing is a relatively easier water sport and can easily be picked up by any age with some time.</h3>
<h3>Once mastering waterskiing on skis, barefoot can be tried out but is much more difficult.</h3>
